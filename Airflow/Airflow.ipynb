    "# Cloud Composer\n",
    "---\n",
    "Cloud Composer is a fully managed workflow orchestration service, enabling you to create, schedule, monitor, and manage workflow pipelines that span across clouds and on-premises data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Composer is built on the popular Apache Airflow open source project and operates using the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Cloud Composer instead of a local instance of Apache Airflow, you can benefit from the best of Airflow with no installation or management overhead. Cloud Composer helps you create managed Airflow environments quickly and use Airflow-native tools, such as the powerful Airflow web interface and command-line tools, so you can focus on your workflows and not your infrastructure."
